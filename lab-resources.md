            <p><strong>Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy (c-AFM)</strong> for nanoscale electrical characterization enables direct correlation between surface morphology and electrical properties. Our system provides standard AFM modes for topographical and mechanical properties analysis with environmental control capabilities for in-situ measurements. Resolution extends down to sub-nanometer scale for detailed surface morphology analysis, making it ideal for studying organic thin films and device interfaces.</p>
