## Research Opportunities

### Undergraduate Research Opportunities at Union College
Students are strongly encouraged to take part in hands-on research. This is a great way to deepen your learning, gain valuable skills, and explore whether research might be a good fit for your future career. Don’t hesitate to talk with any faculty member about opportunities to join their projects.
For up-to-date information, please refer to **[The Undergraduate Research (UGR) office](https://www.union.edu/undergraduate-research)**. 

#### There are several ways to get involved:

- Summer Research Program – Work on a faculty mentored project for 4, 6, or 8 weeks during the summer.

- Research Practicum – Earn one course credit after completing three practica within a department.

- Work Study Positions – Contribute to ongoing research projects by working 7–8 hours per week during the term.

- Research Courses – Participate in Capstone Projects or Independent Studies, where you can earn course credit for original research.

- Other Opportunities – Faculty may occasionally have additional projects or collaborations for students.

Getting involved early helps you develop valuable skills in experimental methods, data analysis, scientific communication, and teamwork.
