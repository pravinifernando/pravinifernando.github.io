## Research Interests

Pravini's research focuses on sustainable organic electronic materials. Her group investigates how processing parameters affect nanoscale morphology, charge transport, and performance in organic thin films. She specializes in thin-film fabrication, conductive AFM, and structural characterization of device-relevant materials such as organic photovoltaics and semitransparent electrodes. Her work integrates materials physics with green processing strategies to advance environmentally conscious electronics.
