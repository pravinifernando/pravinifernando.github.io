## About the Fernando Research Group

The Fernando Research Group investigates sustainable organic electronic materials with a focus on understanding how processing conditions impact local structure and electronic function. Our research spans fundamental materials physics to applied device characterization, with applications in photovoltaics, sensors, and sustainable electronics.

<!--We foster an inclusive, collaborative research environment where students gain hands-on experience with advanced characterization techniques, develop critical thinking skills, and contribute to cutting-edge materials science research.
