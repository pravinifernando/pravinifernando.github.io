## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="picture.jpg" style="height:200px;width:160px;padding:px;">


Hi! My name is [Pravini Fernando](), I am a _Postdoctoral Research Associate_ at the [Diao Lab]() 
under the supervision of Professor [Ying Diao](https://diao.scs.illinois.edu/about-ying/), 
at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA.

I completed my PHD in _Physics_ at the State University of New York, Binghamton, 
USA under the supervision of Professor [Jeffrey M. Mativetsky](http://www.mativetskylab.com/people/jeffrey-mativetsky). 
I completed my bachelors degree in science from University of Colombo, Sri Lanka specializing in _Physics_.

## Research

My current research work affiliated with [Diao Lab](https://diao.scs.illinois.edu/) focuses on probing chirality 
induced spin selectivity (CISS) and its impact on opto-electrical properties. 

During my PhD, I was a member of the [Mativetsky Lab](http://www.mativetskylab.com) 
@ SUNY Binghamton where my research focused on investigating the connections between morphology, 
molecular structure, and orientation of organic photovoltaic (OPV) 
materials and their impact on electrical connectivity, mainly using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) 
and conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) techniques. 

<!-- In terms of research experience, before my PhD, during my undergraduate years-I have worked in the area of non-linear photonic simulations with Professor [K.A.I.L. Wijewardena Gamalath](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kail_Gamalath). -->
