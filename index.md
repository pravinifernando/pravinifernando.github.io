        <p>
          The Fernando Research Group investigates sustainable organic electronic materials, aiming to connect processing, structure, and electronic function. 
We are fundamentally interested in how processing shapes local material structure and electronic properties, with applications in organic photovoltaics, sensors, and flexible electronic devices.

                    <p> Our research investigates how processing conditions influence film morphology and electronic
performance in organic photovoltaics and semitransparent organic electrodes. We use scanning probe microscopy (SPM) 
techniques such as conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), to study local charge transport at the nanoscale. These insights are complemented by structural characterization 
to provide a broader understanding of processing, morphology, and charge transport.</p>

                    <p>We explore environmentally conscious strategies for processing organic electronic materials, with a focus on reducing reliance on toxic solvents and additives. Our research investigates the use of green solvents, solid additives, and solution blends to control aggregation and morphology in bulk heterojunction systems. In parallel, we study the "green" formulation and post-treatment of PEDOT:PSS-based thin films to understand how conductivity and morphology can be tuned through more sustainable processing approaches.</p>
