## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="picture.jpg" style="height:200px;width:165px;padding:px;">


Hi! My name is [Pravini Fernando]() and I am a PHD candidate in _Physics_ at the State University of New York, Binghamton. I completed my bachelors degree in science from University of Colombo, Sri Lanka specializing in _Physics_.

## Research

Currently, I'm part of the [Mativetsky Lab](http://www.mativetskylab.com) @ SUNY Binghamton under the supervision of Professor [Jeffrey M. Mativetsky](http://www.mativetskylab.com/people/jeffrey-mativetsky) where my current research work focuses on **organic photovoltaics**. In terms of research experience, before my PhD, during my undergraduate years-I have worked in the area of non-linear photonic simulations with Professor [K.A.I.L. Wijewardena Gamalath](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kail_Gamalath).
