        <p>
            The Fernando Research Group explores sustainable organic electronic material systems, focusing on how processing conditions impact local structure and electronic function. Our research is driven by a fundamental interest in how processing pathways give rise to functional properties, with relevance to applications in photovoltaics, sensors, and soft, sustainable electronic devices.</p>

                    <p>Our research investigates how solution processing conditions influence film morphology and electronic performance in organic photovoltaics and semitransparent organic electrodes. We use scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques such as conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), to study local charge transport at the nanoscale. These insights are complemented by structural characterization to build a comprehensive picture of phase behavior, aggregation, and conductivity across multiple length scales.</p>

                    <p>We explore environmentally conscious strategies for processing organic electronic materials, with a focus on reducing reliance on toxic solvents and additives. Our research investigates the use of green solvents, solid additives, and solution blends to control aggregation and morphology in bulk heterojunction systems. In parallel, we study the "green" formulation and post-treatment of PEDOT:PSS-based thin films to understand how conductivity and morphology can be tuned through more sustainable processing approaches.</p>
